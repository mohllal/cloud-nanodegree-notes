# Section 1: Cloud Computing

## What is cloud computing?

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with *pay-as-you-go* pricing.

## Types of cloud computing

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)

## Cloud Computing Deployment Models

- Cloud
- Hybrid
- On-premises

*Amazon has 69 Availability Zones within 22 geographic regions around the world.*

## AWS Terminology

- ***Region***: AWS regions consist of multiple Availability Zones (AZs), at least two AZs, each of which is a fully isolated partition of the AWS infrastructure that consists of discrete data centers, with redundant power, networking and connectivity, housed in separate facilities.

- ***Availability Zone***: Each AZ can be multiple data centers, and at full scale can be hundreds of thousands of servers. They are fully isolated partitions of the AWS Global Infrastructure. With their own power infrastructure, the AZs are physically separated by a meaningful distance, many km, from any other AZ.

- ***Local Zone***: AWS Local Zones are a new type of AWS infrastructure deployment that places AWS compute, storage, database, and other select services closer to large population, industry, and IT centers. With AWS Local Zones, you can easily run latency-sensitive portions of applications local to end-users and resources in a specific geography, delivering single-digit millisecond latency for use cases such as media & entertainment content creation, real-time gaming, reservoir simulations, electronic design automation, and machine learning.

- ***Point of Presence***: AWS Points of Presence (PoP) locations consist of Edge Locations and Regional Edge Cache servers. Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment.

## AWS Local Zones

- AWS Local Zones are a new type of AWS infrastructure deployment that places AWS compute, storage, database, and other select services closer to large population, industry, and IT centers where no AWS Region exists today.

- AWS Local Zones provide a high-bandwidth, secure connection between local workloads and those running in the AWS Region.

## Shared Responsibility Model

- AWS responsibility ***Security of the Cloud*** – AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud. This infrastructure is composed of the hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run AWS Cloud services.

- Customer responsibility ***Security in the Cloud*** – Customer responsibility will be determined by the AWS Cloud services that a customer selects. This determines the amount of configuration work the customer must perform as part of their security responsibilities.

## Hybrid Cloud

- Hybrid cloud architectures help organizations integrate their on-premises and cloud operations to support a broad spectrum of use cases using a common set of cloud services, tools, and APIs across on-premises and cloud environments.
