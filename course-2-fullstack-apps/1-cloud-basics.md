- ***Cluster***: A collection of instances which perform the same function. It may be used to distribute workloads.

- ***Autoscaling Group***: A type of cluster that can increase or decrease the number of instances based on demand.

- ***Tightly Coupled System***: Tightly coupled systems are quick to stand-up, but may result in higher *technical debt* which is the cost (in time and resources) of additional code rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer to implement.

- ***Loosely Coupled System***: Loosely coupled systems require *more time upfront* but are generally easier to improve upon. One example of loosely coupled system architecture is ***Microservices*** which are individual specialized systems (software deployed on specialized infrastructure) designed to accomplish a specific task. Specific tasks may include things like authentication, image processing, or data management.
