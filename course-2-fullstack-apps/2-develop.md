# Section 2: Develop

- ***Application Program Interface (API)*** is a standard way for multiple parts of a system to interact with each other.

- Some REST API best practices:
  - Only use nouns and no verb. They should be plural and consistent.
  - APIs should be versioned.
  - Lists should paginated to limit the amount of data sent.
  - All responses should attempt to use status codes.
  - All responses should include data format.
  - Error payloads should include descriptive message.

- ***Consumable APIs***: APIs that are accessible to those outside of the organization, for example, a consumable API allows programmers to search Tweets or Yelp reviews.
